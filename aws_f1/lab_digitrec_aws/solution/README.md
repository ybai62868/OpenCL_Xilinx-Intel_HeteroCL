# Digit recognition

## Description
Handwriting recognition refers to the computer's ability to intelligently interpret handwritten inputs and is broadly applied in document processing, signature verification, and bank check clearing. An important step in handwriting recognition is classification, which classifies data into one of a fixed number of classes. In this lab, you will design and implement a handwritten digit recognition system based on the k-nearest-neighbors classifier algorithm. 

## Usage
Please FIRST check out the comments in the file "src/kernel/digitrec.cpp"!

### Software
To run software design:

`source run_sw.sh`

### Hardware: SDAccel
To synthesize and generate bitstream for FPGA:

`source run_hw.sh`

Note: When working on AWS, use .awsxclbin file instead on F1 instance (after AFI is created)
