# OpenCL_Xilinx-Intel_HeteroCL
This is a repo which contains something about how to use OpenCL backend (Xilinx/Intel) to test the samples in HeteroCL website.

If you do not know HeteroCL, you can figure it out through this [link](https://github.com/cornell-zhang/heterocl).

I add the OpenCL backend for HeteroCL ( Xilinx & Intel ), which can be found in this [branch](https://github.com/ybai62868/heterocl/tree/opencl).

If you want to use HeteroCL to run on the AWS, you can use this [branch](https://github.com/ybai62868/heterocl/tree/aws).

### This work had been done when I was an Research Intern at Cornell University (Computer Systems Lab).
