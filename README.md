# OpenCL_Xilinx-Intel_HeteroCL
This is a repo which contains something about how to use OpenCL backend (Xilinx/Intel) to test the samples in HeteroCL website.

## HeteroCL(FPGA'19 Best Paper Award!)

If you do not know HeteroCL, you can figure it out through this [link](https://github.com/cornell-zhang/heterocl).

## Introduction

1. I add the OpenCL backend for HeteroCL ( Xilinx & Intel ), which can be found in this [branch](https://github.com/ybai62868/heterocl/tree/opencl).

2. If you want to use HeteroCL to generate Vivado HLS C++ code and then 

wrapper it into the OpenCL host file run on the AWS, you can use this [branch](https://github.com/ybai62868/heterocl/tree/aws).

## Installation 

Please refer to [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL,md) for installation and environment preparation.

## Get Started

Please see [GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for the basic usage of HeteroCL OpenCL backend.

## Acknowledgement

This work had been done when I was an Intern at Cornell University (Computer Systems Lab).
